			<h2>A little bit of thanks</h2>
			<p>Maybe it's because I'm so close to the educational portion of my life, but I think it's important to thank those that taught me and brought me (pulled, encouraged, prodded...) to where I am now.</p>

			<h3>P. Colin Manikoth <small><a href="http://twitter.com/poukong">@poukong</a></small></h3>
			<p><em>"Colin no crazy!"</em> I am so glad I learned web from Colin. I was in the first web class he taught at NIC and ever other class after. Because of him, the NIC Graphic Design Program was one of the first in the area to teach HTML5 and CSS3. He kept us up to date with the trends, even to the point of being two weeks into class and announcing our jQuery books were now out of date, because jQuery v2 just came out. Therefore, we started working with v2.</p>
			<p>I am a web designer because of Colin's teaching. In the future, I hope to teach design too, and I want to teach like him.</p>

			<h3>Dave Van Etten <small><a href="http://twitter.com/vanettda">@vanettda</a></small></h3>
			<p>Dave, the stalwart illustrator and purveyor of humorous logic. He teaches students how to take a stylus and make it not only a paintbrush, pencil, or pen, but an extension of the hand and mind. Always a source of encouragement and "this is the thing" advice, his "boys vs. girls" illustration lecture is not to be missed.</p>

			<p>Philippe is the reason I even attended the North Idaho College Design Program (well, my mom was the first prompter). Through the years there, his teaching and prompting pushed me to the place I am now. It is his bulldoggish determination that has brought NIC GDES to where it is now, and it is that same determination and belief in his students that keeps it moving forward.</p>
